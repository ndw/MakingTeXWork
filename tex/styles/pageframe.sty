%%
%%  By default, draws a frame around the text area to represent
%%  the edge of the paper -- useful when pages for a book of size
%%  7x9 inches (for example) is being proofed on 8 1/2 x 11 inch
%%  paper.  If \pageframefalse is executed, the part of the frame
%%  beside the text is removed, leaving only the corner marks
%%  to use for checking registration and for cropping.
%%  The full frame can be restored by executing \pageframetrue.
%%
%%  This shows the results of
%%
%%       \pageframetrue  and   \pageframefalse
%%
%%        _|__________|_       _|          |_
%%         |          |

%%         |          |         |          |
%%
%%
%%  This style option also prints (outside the page area) a timestamp,
%%  a job ID, and the page number and a sequence number on each page.
%%  The sequence number advances throughout the document, so even if
%%  there is a page (i) and several pages 1, only the first page
%%  will have sequence number 1.
%%
%%  An oversight in the original version sometimes caused the tag line
%%  to be printed in an unusual font (if that was the last-used font
%%  on the preceding page).  The current version explicitly sets the
%%  font for the tag line so that this won't happen.  The default is
%%  to use cmr10, since it's highly unlikely that there are any TeX
%%  sites that don't have this font available, but the \pffont macro
%%  is provided in case another font is desired.
%%
%%  Two more features have been added: an "inner skeleton", consisting
%%  of rules that demarcate the header, footer, and text area, and a
%%  "text grid" that can be placed inside the text area.  Use
%%  "\innerskeltrue" or "\innerskelfalse" to control the skeleton
%%  and "\textgridtrue" or "\textgridfalse" to control the text grid.
%%  Use (for example) "\gridsize{10pt}{12pt}" to make a grid whose
%%  squares have width 10pt and height 12pt.
%%
%%  To use this style option, include pageframe as an optional argument
%%  in the \documentstyle command, e.g.
%%
%%                 \documentstyle[pageframe]{book}
%%
%%  Also you must tell LaTeX the height of the paper you are using
%%  (it can deduce the width for itself).  You do this by including
%%  a declaration such as
%%                         \paperheight{9in}
%%
%%  in the preamble of your document.  This *must* appear before
%%  the first page of output, because the new output routine
%%  uses this value.  (If you forget to specify it, then two
%%  things will happen: the vertical rules at the sides of the
%%  text will disappear, because LaTeX thinks they have height 0pt,
%%  and the rule that represents the bottom of the paper will be
%%  flush against the bottom of the footer.)
%%
%%  Since this style file modifies (a part of) LaTeX's output routine,
%%  it is exceedingly unlikely to be compatible with any other style
%%  option that also modifies the output routine.
%%

%%  to  CAMERON@MIDD.BITNET  or  cameron@midd.cs.middlebury.edu

%%  were running on and (b) probably suitable for this purpose
